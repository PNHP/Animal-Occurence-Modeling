## `r paste(FocalSp)` Abundance Models Output

The null model for `r FocalSp` (with constant environmental and observational covariates) yields the following:
```{r null model}
(M0 <- multinomPois(~1 ~1, umf.cr1, engine="R"))

```

# Back transform to get detection and abundance estimates

This is the detection probability for the null model:
```{r null model results, include=TRUE}
#this is the detection probability for the null model
backTransform(M0, type="det")

#This is the abundance estimate for the null model:
backTransform(M0, type="state")

#Estimate posterior distributions of latent abundance using empirical Bayes methods
re <- ranef(M0)
EBUP <- bup(re, stat="mean")
CI <- confint(re, level=0.9)
rbind(PAO = c(Estimate = sum(EBUP), colSums(CI)) / 790)
```

Null model results, continued 
This is the expected abundance for the null model, after correcting for detection rate: `r sum(predict(M0, type="state")$Predicted)` 
<br>
This is the realized abundance for the null model (what was actually observed): `r sum(bup(re, stat="mode"))` 
<br>

```{r model including just JulianDate as envir. covariate} 
(M0.date <- multinomPois(~1 ~JulianDate, umf.cr1, engine="R"))
```

Back transform to get detection and abundance estimates

This is the detection probability for the model with variables:
```{r date model results, include=TRUE}
#this is the detection probability for the  model
backTransform(M0.date, type="det")

#This is the abundance estimate for the  model, but we have to factor in the variablees present:
lc <- linearComb(M0.date, c(1, 0), type="state") # Estimate abundance on the log scale when date=0; you can put in different levels for the variable if desired (e.g. its maximum, 1)
backTransform(lc) #Abundance on the original scale

#Estimate posterior distributions of latent abundance using empirical Bayes methods
re <- ranef(M0.date)
EBUP <- bup(re, stat="mean")
CI <- confint(re, level=0.9)
rbind(PAO = c(Estimate = sum(EBUP), colSums(CI)) / 790)
```

Model with date, continued 
This is the expected abundance for the date model, after correcting for detection rate: `r sum(predict(M0.date, type="state")$Predicted)` 
<br>
This is the realized abundance for the  model (what was actually observed): `r sum(bup(re, stat="mode"))` 
<br>
# Variable Relationship Plots
```{r plot, Julian Date, echo=FALSE}
nd <- data.frame(JulianDate=seq(0, 1, length=50))
E.abundance <- predict(M0.date, type="state", newdata=nd, appendData=TRUE)
plot(Predicted ~ JulianDate, E.abundance, type="l", ylab="VIRA / point", xlab="Julian Date")
lines(lower ~ JulianDate, E.abundance, col=gray(0.7))
lines(upper ~ JulianDate, E.abundance, col=gray(0.7))
